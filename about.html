      <p class="about-one">
        The places where guys can feel comfortable and receive great services
        along with excellent grooming are always in demand and popular.
      </p>

      <p class="about-two">
        Keeping this in mind, we decided to create a special barber shop where
        all the traditions of classical barbering will be preserved.
      </p>
      <p class="about-three">
        At Billy, experience begins when you walk through the door. We have
        created the perfect atmosphere where you can relax and get your desired
        haircut.
      </p>

      <p class="about-four">
        The smell, the music, the décor – everything will take you back to a
        time when taking care how you looked was a part of being a man, a true
        gentleman.
      </p>
      <p class="about-five">
        Our main goal is to get to know our clients and what they desire. You
        don’t have to make any appointments, just visit us when you have time
        and one of our barbers will take care of you.
